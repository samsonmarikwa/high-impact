        <h3 class="about-header">Our Beliefs</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">The Scriptures</h4><p>Both the Old and New Testament are inspired of God. They are the
          revelation of God to man and the only infallible, authoritative rule of
          faith and conduct. 2 Timothy 3: 16, 1 Thessalonians 2:13, 2 Peter 1: 21
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">The Godhead</h4><p>Our God is one, eternally existing in three persons, the
          Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, being co-equal (Philippians 2: 6).
          God the Father, the Creator of heaven and earth is the source of the Word
          and the begetter (John 14:28, John 16:28, John 1:14). The Son is the Word
          made flesh, fully God and fully man, the only begotten, and has existed
          with the Father from the beginning (John 1:1). The Holy Spirit proceeds
          forth from the Father and is eternal (John 15: 26).
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">Man, his fall and Redemption</h4><p>Man is a created being made in the likeness
          and image of God. Through Adam’s transgression and fall, sin came into the
          world. Jesus Christ the Son of God, was manifested to destroy the works of
          the devil. He gave His life and shed His blood to redeem man and restore
          him to relationship with God. Salvation is the gift of God to man,
          separate from works and the Law and is made operative by grace through
          faith in Jesus Christ, producing works acceptable to God. (Romans 3:10,
          23; 5: 12; 1John 3:8; Ephesians 2: 8-10).
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">The New Birth and Eternal Life</h4><p>Man’s first step towards salvation is
          godly sorrow that produces repentance. Salvation is received through
          repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ. Those who
          are born again of the Holy Spirit receive eternal life. 2 Corinthians
          7:10; 1 John 5:12; John 3:3-5
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">
          The Church and its Mission
          </h4><p>The Lord Jesus Christ is the Head of the
          universal Church, which is His body. Each believer, having trusted in Him
          as Savior and Lord, is an integral part of the universal Church. The
          purpose of the Church is to proclaim God’s truth, to administer the
          ordinances, to stimulate growth toward maturity and to bring glory to God
          through worship. Ephesians 1:22-23; 2: 22; Heb 12:23
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">Water Baptism Baptism
          </h4><p>Water baptism is by immersion in water and is for believers only.
          It is a direct commandment of our Lord and is a symbol of the believer’s
          identification with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection. Matthew
          28:19; Col 2: 12
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">
          Communion
          </h4><p>Communion is a symbol, memorial and proclamation of the
          suffering and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is to be participated by
          believers until Christ's return. Matthew 26: 17-30
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">
          Baptism in the Holy Spirit
          </h4><p>Baptism in the Holy Spirit brings divine
          power for life and service, the gifts of the Holy Spirit and their use in
          the ministry of the Body of Christ. Baptism in the Holy Spirit is
          evidenced by speaking with other tongues as the Spirit enables. This
          experience is distinct from and subsequent to the experience of the new
          birth. Acts 2: 4; Luke 24: 49; 1 Corinthians 12: 1-31
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">
          Sanctification
          </h4><p>The Bible teaches that without holiness no man can see
          the Lord. Sanctification is a definite yet progressive work of grace, by
          which the believer is purified in heart and mind, commencing at the time
          of regeneration and continuing until the consummation of salvation.
          Hebrews 12: 14; 1 Thessalonians 5: 23
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">
          Divine Healing
          </h4><p>Healing for physical illnesses of the human body is
          produced by the power of God through the prayer of faith and laying on of
          hands. It is provided for in the atonement of Christ and it is the
          privilege of every member of the Church today. Mark 16: 18; James 5:
          14-15; 1 Peter 2: 24; Matthew 8: 17
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">
          The Return of Our Lord and the Resurrection of the Just
          </h4><p>We anticipate the promised return of our Lord as King of kings and Lord of lords, which
          could occur at any moment. We believe that all who have died in Christ
          shall rise first then those who are alive and remain shall be caught up
          together with them to meet the Lord. Acts 1:11; 1 Thessalonians 4: 16-17
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">
          Future Reward and Punishment
          </h4><p>We believe that at the moment of death,
          believers pass immediately into the presence of Christ and remain there in
          joyful fellowship with Him until the resurrection of the body at His
          second coming, after which they will be forever with the Lord of glory in
          Heaven. We also believe that at the moment of death, the unsaved descend
          to Hades where they are kept under punishment until their bodies are
          raised at the final judgment, after which they will suffer everlasting
          conscious punishment in Hell, separated from the presence of the Lord.
          Hebrews 9:27; Revelation 19: 20
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">
          Marriage and Family
          </h4><p>We believe God ordained marriage and the family as
          the foundational institution of human society, and that the only
          legitimate marriage is a sacred and permanent covenant relationship
          between one man and one woman, symbolizing the union of Christ and his
          Church. The husband is to be the servant leader in the home and is to love
          his wife as Christ loves the church, and the wife is to submit herself to
          the Scriptural leadership of her husband as the church submits to the
          headship of Christ (Genesis 2:18-25; Matthew 19:4-6; Ephesians 5:22-25).
          We believe God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity is to be
          engaged in outside of the marriage of a man and a woman. Any form of child
          molestation, fornication, adultery, homosexuality, lesbianism, bestiality,
          bisexuality, incest, pedophilia or pornography is a sinful perversion of
          God’s gift of sex. We believe God disapproves of and forbids any attempt
          to alter one’s gender by surgery or appearance. (Genesis 2:22-24; 19:5,
          13; Leviticus 18:1-30; Matthew 19:4-6; Romans 1:26-29; 7:2; First
          Corinthians 5:1; 6:9; Gal. 3:28; Ephesians 5:22-23; First Thessalonians
          4:1-8; Hebrews 13:4).
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="about-beliefs">Abortion</h4><p>
          We believe that children are a blessing from the Lord. Thus all human life
          is sacred and worthy of protection from the moment of conception to the
          time of natural birth.
