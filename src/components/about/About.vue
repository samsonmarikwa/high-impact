          <h3 class="about-header">Our Beliefs</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">The Scriptures</h4>
              <p>
                Both the Old and New Testament are inspired of God. They are the
                revelation of God to man and the only infallible, authoritative rule of
                faith and conduct. 2 Timothy 3: 16, 1 Thessalonians 2:13, 2 Peter 1: 21
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">The Godhead</h4>
              <p>
                Our God is one, eternally existing in three persons, the
                Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, being co-equal (Philippians 2: 6).
                God the Father, the Creator of heaven and earth is the source of the Word
                and the begetter (John 14:28, John 16:28, John 1:14). The Son is the Word
                made flesh, fully God and fully man, the only begotten, and has existed
                with the Father from the beginning (John 1:1). The Holy Spirit proceeds
                forth from the Father and is eternal (John 15: 26).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">Man, his fall and Redemption</h4>
              <p>
                Man is a created being made in the likeness
                and image of God. Through Adam’s transgression and fall, sin came into the
                world. Jesus Christ the Son of God, was manifested to destroy the works of
                the devil. He gave His life and shed His blood to redeem man and restore
                him to relationship with God. Salvation is the gift of God to man,
                separate from works and the Law and is made operative by grace through
                faith in Jesus Christ, producing works acceptable to God. (Romans 3:10,
                23; 5: 12; 1John 3:8; Ephesians 2: 8-10).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">The New Birth and Eternal Life</h4>
              <p>
                Man’s first step towards salvation is
                godly sorrow that produces repentance. Salvation is received through
                repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ. Those who
                are born again of the Holy Spirit receive eternal life. 2 Corinthians
                7:10; 1 John 5:12; John 3:3-5
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">The Church and its Mission</h4>
              <p>
                The Lord Jesus Christ is the Head of the universal Church, which is His body. Each believer, having trusted in Him
                as Savior and Lord, is an integral part of the universal Church. The
                purpose of the Church is to proclaim God’s truth, to administer the
                ordinances, to stimulate growth toward maturity and to bring glory to God
                through worship. Ephesians 1:22-23; 2: 22; Heb 12:23
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">Water Baptism Baptism</h4>
              <p>
                Water baptism is by immersion in water and is for believers only.
                It is a direct commandment of our Lord and is a symbol of the believer’s
                identification with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection. Matthew
                28:19; Col 2: 12
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">Communion</h4>
              <p>
                Communion is a symbol, memorial and proclamation of the
                suffering and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is to be participated by
                believers until Christ's return. Matthew 26: 17-30
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">Baptism in the Holy Spirit</h4>
              <p>
                Baptism in the Holy Spirit brings divine
                power for life and service, the gifts of the Holy Spirit and their use in
                the ministry of the Body of Christ. Baptism in the Holy Spirit is
                evidenced by speaking with other tongues as the Spirit enables. This
                experience is distinct from and subsequent to the experience of the new
                birth. Acts 2: 4; Luke 24: 49; 1 Corinthians 12: 1-31
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">Sanctification</h4>
              <p>
                The Bible teaches that without holiness no man can see
                the Lord. Sanctification is a definite yet progressive work of grace, by
                which the believer is purified in heart and mind, commencing at the time
                of regeneration and continuing until the consummation of salvation.
                Hebrews 12: 14; 1 Thessalonians 5: 23
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">Divine Healing</h4>
              <p>
                Healing for physical illnesses of the human body is
                produced by the power of God through the prayer of faith and laying on of
                hands. It is provided for in the atonement of Christ and it is the
                privilege of every member of the Church today. Mark 16: 18; James 5:
                14-15; 1 Peter 2: 24; Matthew 8: 17
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">The Return of Our Lord and the Resurrection of the Just</h4>
              <p>
                We anticipate the promised return of our Lord as King of kings and Lord of lords, which
                could occur at any moment. We believe that all who have died in Christ
                shall rise first then those who are alive and remain shall be caught up
                together with them to meet the Lord. Acts 1:11; 1 Thessalonians 4: 16-17
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">Future Reward and Punishment</h4>
              <p>
                We believe that at the moment of death,
                believers pass immediately into the presence of Christ and remain there in
                joyful fellowship with Him until the resurrection of the body at His
                second coming, after which they will be forever with the Lord of glory in
                Heaven. We also believe that at the moment of death, the unsaved descend
                to Hades where they are kept under punishment until their bodies are
                raised at the final judgment, after which they will suffer everlasting
                conscious punishment in Hell, separated from the presence of the Lord.
                Hebrews 9:27; Revelation 19: 20
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">Marriage and Family</h4>
              <p>
                We believe God ordained marriage and the family as
                the foundational institution of human society, and that the only
                legitimate marriage is a sacred and permanent covenant relationship
                between one man and one woman, symbolizing the union of Christ and his
                Church. The husband is to be the servant leader in the home and is to love
                his wife as Christ loves the church, and the wife is to submit herself to
                the Scriptural leadership of her husband as the church submits to the
                headship of Christ (Genesis 2:18-25; Matthew 19:4-6; Ephesians 5:22-25).
                We believe God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity is to be
                engaged in outside of the marriage of a man and a woman. Any form of child
                molestation, fornication, adultery, homosexuality, lesbianism, bestiality,
                bisexuality, incest, pedophilia or pornography is a sinful perversion of
                God’s gift of sex. We believe God disapproves of and forbids any attempt
                to alter one’s gender by surgery or appearance. (Genesis 2:22-24; 19:5,
                13; Leviticus 18:1-30; Matthew 19:4-6; Romans 1:26-29; 7:2; First
                Corinthians 5:1; 6:9; Gal. 3:28; Ephesians 5:22-23; First Thessalonians
                4:1-8; Hebrews 13:4).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="about-beliefs">Abortion</h4>
              <p>
                We believe that children are a blessing from the Lord. Thus all human life
                is sacred and worthy of protection from the moment of conception to the
                time of natural birth.
